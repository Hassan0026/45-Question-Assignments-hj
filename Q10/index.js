// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
console.log('PROGRAM 1');
console.log('Hassan jamshed', new Date());
console.log('this is a simple way to write a famous person quotation');
console.log("Albert Einstein once said,\"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.\"");
var famous_person = 'Albert Einstein';
var message = "\"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.\u201D";
console.log('PROGRAM 2');
console.log('Hassan jamshed', new Date());
console.log('In this method we put the authors name & his quote in a variable and then print it ');
console.log("".concat(famous_person, " once said, ").concat(message));
